# Formula 1 ETL Pipeline

This project is designed to build an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline using Formula 1 data on AWS. The pipeline will automate the process of extracting data from various Formula 1 data sources, transforming it into a suitable format, and loading it into AWS for further analysis and visualization. The goal is to leverage AWS services to efficiently handle large volumes of data, ensuring scalability and reliability.

## Key Features
- **Data Extraction**: Collect data from multiple Formula 1 data sources.
- **Data Transformation**: Process and clean the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Data Loading**: Load the transformed data into AWS services for storage and analysis.
- **Scalability**: Utilize AWS's scalable infrastructure to handle growing data volumes.
- **Reliability**: Ensure data integrity and availability through robust AWS solutions.
